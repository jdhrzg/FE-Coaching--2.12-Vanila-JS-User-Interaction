This is an exercise assigned to me by my front end dev coach, meant to practice and learn about the below...

 2.12 Exercise: Build something with vanilla JS, no libraries allowed. Include:
 - Fetch calls
 - Prototypes
 - User interactions/button clicks
 - Updating a single component in several ways depending on user actions
 - setTimeout 
 - setInterval
 - Q: How precise are setTimeout and setInterval?
    - How close to the millisecond are they to the value you passed in
 - Keeping UI responsive and not freezing
    - Build a long running-process with “start” and “stop” buttons
    - Implement loading animations for fetch calls
    - Use both sync and async fetch calls
